# Datastory Weekly Chart
This repository contains data and analysis for the [Datastory Weekly Charts](https://datastory.org/sv/veckans-graf) which are posted on Datastory.org and on social media.

## Installation

To run the notebooks, you need to install the packages listed in the `Pipfile`. The easiest way is to use [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): `pipenv install`. This will install all dependencies as well as the local `src` package that contain some utility functions that are used in various notebooks.

An additional dependency (ImageMagick) is needed to generate GIFs. Please refer to the ImageMagick website for installation documentation.

## Data
Data is collected from a variety of sources. Each notebook contains a source reference and a date for when the data was originally obtained.
